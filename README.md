# Outskirts::Vector

vector math library in Outskirts System

## Dependency

1. outskirts.util.Vector3f used 2 method "unit" AND "lerp" from outskirts.util.Maths 
   (but they are extra tool method, so you can also remove the relevant in Vector3f is ok)
2. java 8 (actually java 1.5+)

other than that, the library has no other dependencies.
